# MODSFinder ECU Binary Dump

This repository contains a public dump of **15,493 ECU binaries** extracted from the now-defunct tool **MODSFinder: Automatic ECU Tuning Solution**, formerly hosted at [tuning-database.co.uk](https://www.tuning-database.co.uk/).

## 📜 Background

Years ago, I purchased a license for MODSFinder — a tool that claimed to offer automated ECU tuning for professionals and enthusiasts alike. The promises were ambitious, but the reality was far from it:

- The software failed to deliver many of its advertised features.
- Customer support was non-existent or hostile.
- Trustpilot and other platforms are filled with similar complaints from other users.

After left with a non-functional license, I developed a small dumper to extract all accessible ECU binary files while the license was still valid. These files have been sitting on a forgotten server for years — until now.

## 🔓 Why Publish This?

This release is about transparency and giving back to the tuning community. The files may be outdated, and without access to MODSFinder’s servers they are of limited use — but they remain a testament to what was hidden behind a paid wall of false promises.

## 📦 What’s Included

- `ECU Binarys/` – Folder containing **15,493 ECU binaries**, organized by internal naming structure.
- Files are unmodified dumps from the original MODSFinder client during license-valid access.
- Metadata about supported models will be added in a later update.

> ⚠️ Note: **I dont know** how relevant these files are today or if they have been leaked already.

## 💬 Final Words

This release isn't about revenge — it's about transparency. If you've been scammed by the same people, you’re not alone. Let this serve as a warning to others and a small contribution back to a community that deserves better.

Stay tuned.
